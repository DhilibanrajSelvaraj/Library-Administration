# Library-Administration

This is a simple Python Library Management project.

Welcome to Dhilib's Library, where you can find any book you want to read.

Users will have the option of displaying the library, adding or removing books, or both. Return any borrowed books, lend a book

This has all of the features that an online library should have, including the ability to display the lender's name if someone lends you a book and you enter that book.

All of the basic functions, such as removing or adding books, have been added.

It employs an infinite while loop, and we must press 'n' to exit it, and it will accept that input only until all of the books have been returned.

If a book is already in the library and the user attempts to return it, it will prompt the user to first lend the book.

Keeps a dictionary of the book with the names of those who have borrowed it.

There are no requirements; simply import it into your Python IDE and it should work fine.

I hope you like it.
